# Nixos-config


this is my nixos configuration

this is the general documentation for it

you will need to activate wpa_supplicant and run the commmand

____ to run it correctly on first install, I also recomend you put your wifi ssid and psk in the module/core/networking

if you want to isntall a package go to programs/ 

there is different directoies in this folder, if you put it in the list of programs it will download the default config, if you create a file like neovim, it will install still and run
